# Core Enhancement: Reading and Writing State files from multiple versions

From the Terraform `0.14` [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.14/CHANGELOG.md):

> `terraform init` will now generate a lock file in the configuration directory which you can check in to your version control so that Terraform can make the same version selections in future.
